# Database Connectivity
MYSQL Connectivity

Purpose: Retrieve information from the user through the Graphical User Interface (GUI) and display the records in the terminal using the MYSQL 
connectivity (through 2 seperate projects).

Project 1: In the default package, users can manage the database and navigate through the records that they have entered. Through the Employee registration 
page, the user can enter their information into the text fields and manage the database (view their records in the terminal).

Project 2: In the project package, users can pick from several radio buttons to place an order at a burrito shop. The first page displays a Welcome page
asking for the user's name and phone number (only accepting 10 numeric values). If the user does not enter their name/phone number a message dialog will
display asking to fill out the fields (making the text fields required). Users can clear the text fields, view the previous page, exit the shop, and 
view the next page. Taking into account the user's choices, it will display a total bill page where users can view how much they have to pay. 

Note: Both projects include connectivity through the MYSQL database backend that will display (add/remove) data via the terminal.
